## Version 0.0.5

This release now makes it so that all quotifier quotes are in comments in the html and not visible on to the user. As such it is much less obtrusive and much more in ine with the philosophy of the original Quotifier project. 

For those who miss the old approach of displaying the quotes to the user fear not for this has now become an optional feature you can enable. Take a look at the [readme](https://github.com/almiche/quotifier_as_middleware/blob/master/README.md#optional-features) for more info.

## Version 0.0.3 

Implemented the quotify gem by famingo instead of in house solution in previous release 0.0.2 code name "Quantico". Added support for inline javascript and css scripts within a file.
